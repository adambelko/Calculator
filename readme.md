Calculator

An online calculator with basic mathematical operations.

Features:
- Clear and Delete button functions
- Keyboard support
- Support for 3 decimal places if needed

What I've learned: 
- Think twice. write once. There was a number of times where I had to re-factor large portions of code due to it's unnecessary complexity which was causing additional issues down the line
- Breaking down more complex problems into smaller, managable solutions
- Keyboard support integration
